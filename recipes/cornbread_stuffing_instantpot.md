## Ingredients

5-6 cups Prepared Cornbread Pieces (or cook an 8oz box mix in a 8"x8" dish and use that)
1/2 cup Butter
1 small Onion, diced
1 cup Celery, diced
2 tsp Rubbed Sage
1/2 tsp Poultry Seasoning
1 tsp Kosher Salt
1/4 tsp Pepper
1 clove Garlic, pressed or finely minced
1 1/2 cups Turkey Broth
1 1/2 cups Water, for the pressure cooker

## Instructions

Break up the cornbread into a mixing bowl and set aside. This can be done ahead of time if you want it to dry out a bit first (fresh cornbread will yield a softer stuffing).

Turn on the Sauté function on your Instant Pot (Normal, Med heat) and add the butter, onions, celery, sage, poultry seasoning, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until vegetables soften.

Add the garlic and sauté with the vegetables for a couple of minutes.

Add the vegetable mixture to the cornbread and stir.

Add the turkey broth to the cornbread and combine.

Put the cornbread mixture into a sprayed 6 cup bundt pan, or a metal pan, such as the ekovana Stackable Stainless Pans.

Cover the pan with foil and seal it well.

Rinse out the inner pot, dry it, and put it back in the pressure cooker.

Add the water and a trivet/rack to the inner pot in the pressure cooker.

Use a [sling](#sling) to lower the pan into the pot. Fold over the ends of the sling to get them out of the way. Make sure they don't block the steam valve.

Close and lock the lid in place, and set the Steam Release Knob to the Sealing position (on the Ultra, just close and lock the lid).

Press the Pressure Cook/ Manual button, High Pressure, and choose 15 minutes using the + or - buttons (or the dial on the Ultra).

When the cook cycle has ended, do a Quick Release of the steam by turning the steam Release Knob to Venting (or push the button on the Ultra).

When all of the pressure is out and the pin in the lid drops, open it and remove the pan to a cooling rack.

Leave the foil in place and let it sit for 5 minutes, or while you set the table and get everything else ready.

Serve hot.


### Sling

Usually made with aluminum foil, used to get the pan in and out of the pressure cooker easily. Fold a 28” length of foil along the long end 3 times. You will end up with a sling that is 28” x 3” (folding it gives it strength).
